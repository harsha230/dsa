The provided solution for inserting a value into a sorted circular linked list efficiently handles the insertion while maintaining the list's sorted order. 
It begins by checking if the list is empty; if so, it creates a new node that points to itself. If the list is not empty, 
the algorithm traverses the list using two pointers: prev and curr. It checks three cases during the traversal: (1) if the insertVal fits between prev and curr, 
(2) if the list wraps around and insertVal fits either before the smallest value or after the largest value, and (3) if the end of the traversal is reached without finding a specific spot,
it inserts the new node at the end.
The time complexity of this approach is O(N) in the worst case, where N is the number of nodes in the list, as it may require a complete traversal. 
The space complexity is O(1) because only a fixed number of pointers are used regardless of the size of the list.



class Solution {
  public Node insert(Node head, int insertVal) {
    if (head == null) {
      Node newNode = new Node(insertVal, null);
      newNode.next = newNode;
      return newNode;
    }

    Node prev = head;
    Node curr = head.next;
    boolean toInsert = false;

    do {
      if (prev.val <= insertVal && insertVal <= curr.val) {
        // Case 1).
        toInsert = true;
      } else if (prev.val > curr.val) {
        // Case 2).
        if (insertVal >= prev.val || insertVal <= curr.val)
          toInsert = true;
      }

      if (toInsert) {
        prev.next = new Node(insertVal, curr);
        return head;
      }

      prev = curr;
      curr = curr.next;
    } while (prev != head);

    // Case 3).
    prev.next = new Node(insertVal, curr);
    return head;
  }
}
