Approach 1  BFS: Two Queues
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return new ArrayList<Integer>();

        ArrayDeque<TreeNode> nextLevel = new ArrayDeque() {
            {
                offer(root);
            }
        };
        ArrayDeque<TreeNode> currLevel = new ArrayDeque();
        List<Integer> rightside = new ArrayList();

        TreeNode node = null;
        while (!nextLevel.isEmpty()) {
            // prepare for the next level
            currLevel = nextLevel;
            nextLevel = new ArrayDeque<>();

            while (!currLevel.isEmpty()) {
                node = currLevel.poll();

                // add child nodes of the current level
                // in the queue for the next level
                if (node.left != null) nextLevel.offer(node.left);
                if (node.right != null) nextLevel.offer(node.right);
            }

            // The current level is finished.
            // Its last element is the rightmost one.
            if (currLevel.isEmpty()) rightside.add(node.val);
        }
        return rightside;
    }
}
Time complexity: O(N) since one has to visit each node.

Space complexity: O(D) to keep the queues, where D is a tree diameter. Let's use the last level to estimate the queue size. 
This level could contain up to N/2 tree nodes in the case of complete binary tree.

Approach 2  BFS: One Queue + Level Size Measurements
Algorithm

Initiate the list of the right side view rightside.

Initiate the queue by adding a root.

While the queue is not empty:

Write down the length of the current level: levelLength = queue.size().

Iterate over i from 0 to level_length - 1:

Pop the current node from the queue: node = queue.poll().

If i == levelLength - 1, then it's the last node in the current level, push it to rightsize list.

Add first left and then right child node into the queue.

Return rightside.

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return new ArrayList<Integer>();

        ArrayDeque<TreeNode> queue = new ArrayDeque() {
            {
                offer(root);
            }
        };
        List<Integer> rightside = new ArrayList();

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelLength = queue.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < levelLength; ++i) {
                TreeNode node = queue.poll();

                // if it's the rightmost element
                if (i == levelLength - 1) {
                    rightside.add(node.val);
                }

                // add child nodes in the queue
                if (node.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(node.left);
                }
                if (node.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(node.right);
                }
            }
        }
        return rightside;
    }
}
The time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree. 
This is because each node is visited exactly once during the level-order traversal (BFS). For each node, we check its children and add them to the queue, ensuring every node is processed once. 
The space complexity is O(D), where D is the maximum width of the tree, representing the number of nodes at the widest level. 
In the worst case, for a balanced tree, this can be around N/2, leading to O(N) space complexity. 
In the case of a skewed tree, where all nodes are aligned to one side, the space complexity remains O(N). 
Therefore, both time and space complexities are bounded by the number of nodes in the tree.

Approach 3: Recursive DFS

class Solution {
    List<Integer> rightside = new ArrayList();

    public void helper(TreeNode node, int level) {
        if (level == rightside.size()) rightside.add(node.val);

        if (node.right != null) helper(node.right, level + 1);
        if (node.left != null) helper(node.left, level + 1);
    }

    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return rightside;

        helper(root, 0);
        return rightside;
    }
}
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(N) since one has to visit each node.

Space complexity: O(H) to keep the recursion stack, where H is a tree height. The worst-case situation is a skewed tree when H=N.
