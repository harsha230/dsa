In a depth-first search (DFS) approach to topological sorting, the key idea is that nodes are fully explored before they are added to the result list,
following a **post-order traversal**. This ensures that each node is processed only after all its dependencies (or outgoing neighbors) have been processed,
giving a reverse topological order. To detect cycles, we use graph coloring (white for unvisited, gray for in-process, and black for fully visited nodes).
If a gray node is revisited, it indicates a cycle. The time complexity is \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of nodes (letters) and \(E\)
is the number of edges (letter comparisons). The space complexity is also \(O(V + E)\), due to the adjacency list and recursion stack used during DFS.

2) BFS WITH TOPOLOGICAL ORDERING
The given code solves the problem of determining the lexicographical order of characters in an alien language based on a list of words.
It constructs a directed graph where each character points to the characters that must come after it. 
The solution proceeds in three steps: First, it initializes two data structures—an adjacency list to represent the graph 
and a count map to store the in-degrees of characters. Next, it iterates through adjacent words to build the graph by comparing
characters and recording edges between differing characters. If a word is a prefix of the next but comes later, the order is invalid,
so the function returns `""`. Lastly, it uses Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting via a breadth-first search (BFS) to determine 
the valid character order. If any characters remain unprocessed due to cycles or inconsistencies, the function returns an empty string.
Otherwise, it returns the valid ordering.

### Time Complexity (TC): 
- Constructing the graph and adjacency list takes O(C), where C is the total number of characters across all words. 
- The BFS topological sort runs in O(V + E), where V is the number of unique characters and E is the number of edges (relations between characters).
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(C + V + E).

### Space Complexity (SC):
- We use space for the adjacency list, in-degree map, and the queue, 
all of which take O(V + E), where V is the number of unique characters and E is the number of relations between them.
