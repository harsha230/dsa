The brute-force approach to finding the shortest clear path in a binary matrix involves using depth-first search (DFS)
to explore all potential paths from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right cell `(n - 1, n - 1)`.
The algorithm checks if the starting or ending cell is blocked (value `1`), and if so, it returns `-1`.
It marks cells as visited during exploration to prevent revisiting, tracking the length of each path and 
updating the minimum length found upon reaching the destination. The DFS explores all 8 possible directions
(horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) from the current cell. If no clear path is found, the algorithm returns `-1`.
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(2^{n^2})\) in the worst case due to the exponential number of paths explored,
while the space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) for the recursive call stack in the worst case.
